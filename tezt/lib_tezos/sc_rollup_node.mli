(** Spawn smart-contract rollup nodes and control them. *)

(** This module follows the same conventions as in {!Node}. We write
   [sc node] to refer to [smart-contract rollup node]. *)

(** Smart contract rollup node states. *)
type t

(** Create a smart contract rollup node.

    A smart contract rollup node is associated to a tezos node
    passed as argument.

    The standard output and standard error output of the sc node will
    be logged with prefix [name] and color [color].

    Default [data_dir] is a temporary directory
    which is always the same for each [name].

    Default [event_pipe] is a temporary file
    whose name is derived from [name]. It will be created
    as a named pipe so that sc node events can be received.

    Default values for [net_port] or [rpc_port] are chosen automatically
    with values starting from 17384 (configurable with `--starting-port`).
    They are used by [config_init]
    and by functions from the [Client] module. They are not used by [run],
    so if you do not call [config_init] or generate the configuration file
    through some other means, your sc node will not listen.
