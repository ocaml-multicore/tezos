(** Spawn Tezos nodes and control them. *)

(** Convention: in this module, some functions implement node commands;
    those functions are named after those commands.
    For instance, [Node.config_init] corresponds to [tezos-node config init],
    and [Node.run] corresponds to [tezos-node run].

    The arguments of those functions are also named after the actual arguments.
    For instance, [?network] is named after [--network], to make
    [Node.config_init ~network:"carthagenet"] look as close as possible
    to [tezos-node config init --network carthagenet].

    Most options have default values which are not necessarily the default values
    of [tezos-node]. Indeed, the latter are tailored for Mainnet, but here we
    use defaults which are tailored for the sandbox. In particular, the default
    value for [?network] is ["sandbox"].
    However, if you specify an option such as [~network] or [~history_mode],
    they are passed to the node unchanged, to reduce surprises.

    These conventions are also followed in the [Client] module. *)

(** History modes for the node. *)

(** The parameter for [Full] And [Rolling] mode is called
   [additional_cycles].

    For the [Full] (resp. [Rolling]) mode it controls the number of
   contexts (resp. blocks) we preserved behind the [checkpoint] (aka
   the no fork point]). Default in sandbox mode is [2] and [5] for
   mainnet parameters (see [preserved_cycles] in the protocol
   parameters). *)
type history_mode = Archive | Full of int option | Rolling of int option

(** Values that can be passed to the node's [--media-type] argument *)
type media_type = Json | Binary | Any

(** Tezos node command-line arguments.

    Not all arguments are available here.
    Some are simply not implemented, and some are handled separately
    because they need special care. The latter are implemented as optional
    labeled arguments (e.g. [?net_port] and [?data_dir]). *)
type argument =
  | Network of string  (** [--network] *)
  | History_mode of history_mode  (** [--history-mode] *)

(** Tezos node states. *)
type t

(** Create a node.

    This function just creates the [t] value, it does not call
    [identity_generate] nor [config_init] nor [run].

    The standard output and standard error output of the node will
    be logged with prefix [name] and color [color].

    Default [data_dir] is a temporary directory
    which is always the same for each [name].

    Default [event_pipe] is a temporary file
    whose name is derived from [name]. It will be created
    as a named pipe so that node events can be received.

    Default values for [net_port] or [rpc_port] are chosen automatically
    with values starting from 16384 (configurable with `--starting-port`).
    They are used by [config_init]
    and by functions from the [Client] module. They are not used by [run],
    so if you do not call [config_init] or generate the configuration file
    through some other means, your node will not listen.

    The argument list is a list of configuration options that the node
    should run with. It is passed to the first run of [tezos-node config init].
    It is also passed to all runs of [tezos-node run] that occur before
    [tezos-node config init]. If [Expected_pow] is given, it is also used as
    the default value for {!identity_generate}.

    If [runner] is specified, the node will be spawned on this
    runner using SSH. *)

    [<ADDRESS>] is obtained using [Runner.address runner] with [?from]
    being the runner of [from] and [runner] is the runner of the node.

(** Spawn [tezos-node run].

    The resulting promise is fulfilled as soon as the node has been spawned.

    [event_level] specifies the verbosity of the file descriptor sink.
    This must be at least [`Notice], which is the level of event
    ["node_is_ready.v0"], needed for {!wait_for_ready}.
    The default value is [`Info] which is also the default event level
    of the node.

    [event_sections_levels] specifies the verbosity for events in sections whose
    prefix is in the list. For instance
    [~event_sections_levels:[("prevalidator", `Debug); ("validator.block", `Debug)]]
    will activate the logs at debug level for events whose section starts with
    ["prevalidator"] or ["validator.block"].
    See {!Tezos_stdlib_unix.File_descriptor_sink} and
    {{:https://tezos.gitlab.io/user/logging.html#file-descriptor-sinks}the logging documentation}
    for a more precise semantic.

(** Wait until the node is ready.

    More precisely, wait until a [node_is_ready] event occurs.
    If such an event already occurred, return immediately. *)
val wait_for_ready : t -> unit Lwt.t

(** Wait for a given chain level.

    More precisely, wait until a [node_chain_validator] with a [level]
    greater or equal to the requested level occurs.
    If such an event already occurred, return immediately. *)
val wait_for_level : t -> int -> int Lwt.t

(** Get the current known level of a node.

    Returns [0] if the node is not running or if no [node_chain_validator] event
    was received yet. This makes this function equivalent to [wait_for_level node 0]
    except that it does not actually wait for the level to be known. *)
val get_level : t -> int

(** Wait for the node to read its identity.

    More precisely, wait until a [read_identity] event occurs.
    If such an event already occurred, return immediately.

    Return the identity. *)
val wait_for_identity : t -> string Lwt.t

(** [wait_for_request ?level ~request node] waits for [request] event
   on the [node]. *)
val wait_for_request :
  request:[< `Flush | `Inject | `Notify | `Arrived] -> t -> unit Lwt.t

(** Wait for a custom event to occur.

    Usage: [wait_for_full node name filter]

    If an event named [name] occurs, apply [filter] to its
    whole json, which is of the form:
    {[{
      "fd-sink-item.v0": {
        "hostname": "...",
        "time_stamp": ...,
        "section": [ ... ],
        "event": { <name>: ... }
      }
    }]}
    If [filter] returns [None], continue waiting.
    If [filter] returns [Some x], return [x].

    [where] is used as the [where] field of the [Terminated_before_event] exception
    if the node terminates. It should describe the constraint that [filter] applies,
    such as ["field level exists"].

    It is advised to register such event handlers before starting the node,
    as if they occur before being registered, they will not trigger your handler.
    For instance, you can define a promise with
    [let x_event = wait_for node "x" (fun x -> Some x)]
    and bind it later with [let* x = x_event]. *)
val wait_for_full :
  ?where:string -> t -> string -> (JSON.t -> 'a option) -> 'a Lwt.t

(** Same as [wait_for_full] but ignore metadata from the file descriptor sink.

    More precisely, [filter] is applied to the value of field
    ["fd-sink-item.v0"."event".<name>].

    If the node receives a JSON value that does not match the right
    JSON structure, it is not given to [filter] and the event is
    ignored. See [wait_for_full] to know what the JSON value must
    look like. *)
val wait_for : ?where:string -> t -> string -> (JSON.t -> 'a option) -> 'a Lwt.t

(** Raw events. *)
type event = {name : string; value : JSON.t}

(** Add a callback to be called whenever the node emits an event.

    Contrary to [wait_for] functions, this callback is never removed.

    Listening to events with [on_event] will not prevent [wait_for] promises
    to be fulfilled. You can also have multiple [on_event] handlers, although
    the order in which they trigger is unspecified. *)
val on_event : t -> (event -> unit) -> unit

(** Register an event handler that logs all events.

    Use this when you need to debug or reverse engineer incoming events.
    Usually you do not want to keep that in the final versions of your tests. *)
val log_events : t -> unit

(** Values returned by {!memory_consumption}. *)
type observe_memory_consumption = Observe of (unit -> int option Lwt.t)

(** Observe memory consumption of the node.

    This function requires [perf] and [heaptrack] in the PATH.
    Otherwise, the observation will always return [None].

    The returned function gives the peak of memory consumption
    observed since the observation has started.

    [memory_consumption node] starts the observation and returns
    [Some (Observe get)]. [get ()] stops the observation and
    returns the observation memory consumption.

    Arguments are passed to {!config_init}. If you specified [Expected_pow],
    it is also passed to {!identity_generate}. Arguments are not passed to {!run}.
    If you do not wish the arguments to be stored in the configuration file
