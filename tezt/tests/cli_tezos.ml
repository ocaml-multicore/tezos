(* Wait for a node to be ready or to exit, and fail if the node became ready.

   In this module we sometimes have to wait for an error to happen
   before the node is ready. After this error happens the node exits.
   If the node becomes ready, we know that what we are waiting for will not happen,
   so we raise an error instead of waiting forever.

   But [Node.wait_for_ready] also raises an error if the node exits
   before the node is ready. If we're unlucky with concurrency, we could notice
   that the node exited before reading the error that we expect.
   We make sure this does not happen by catching [Node.Terminated_before_event]. *)
