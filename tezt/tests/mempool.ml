(** Test.

    Aim: test that a refused operation is not reclassified even though
    it would now be valid.

    Scenario:
    - Step 1: Start two nodes, connect them, and activate the protocol.
    - Step 2: In [node2]'s mempool filter configuration, set all fields
      [minimal_*] to 0, so that [node2] accepts operations with any fee.
    - Step 3: Inject two operations (transfers) in [node2] with respective
      fees 1000 and 10 mutez. Check that both operations are [applied] in
      [node2]'s mempool.
    - Step 4: Bake with an empty mempool for [node1] to force synchronization
      with [node2]. Check that the mempool of [node1] has one applied and one
      refused operation. Indeed, [node1] has the default filter config with
      [minimal_fees] at 100 mutez.
    - Step 5: In [node1]'s mempool filter configuration, set all fields
      [minimal_*] to 0. Inject a new operation with fee 5 in [node2], then
      bake with an empty mempool. Check that [node1] contains two applied
      operations (the ones with fee 1000 and 5) and one refused operation.
      Indeed, the operation with fee 10 would now be valid, but it has already
      been refused so it must not be revalidated.
    - Step 6: Bake for [node1] (normally, i.e. without enforcing a given
      mempool). Check that the baked block contains exactly one manager
      operation (the category containing transfer operations). Indeed, the
      filter used to determine which operations are included in the block does
      not share its configuration with the mempool's filter, so only the
      operation of fee 1000 is included. Check that [node1] contains one
      applied operation (fee 5) and one refused operation (fee 10), and that
      [node2] contains two applied operations. *)
