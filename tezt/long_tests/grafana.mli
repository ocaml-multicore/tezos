(** Create Grafana dashboards. *)

(** Grafana configuration.

    [url] is the base URL of the Grafana API.
    [api_token] is the bearer token to use in the Authorization header.
    [data_source] is the name of the InfluxDB data source configured in Grafana. *)
type config = {
  url : Uri.t;
  api_token : string;
  data_source : string;
  timeout : float;
}

(** Read a Grafana configuration from a JSON value. *)
val config_of_json : JSON.t -> config

(** Y axes for Grafana panels.

    [format] is the unit of the axis.
    A typical example is ["s"], meaning "seconds".
    See Grafana documentation for other possible values. *)
type yaxis = {format : string; label : string option}

(** Grafana graph panels.

    Queries should use [Grafana_time_filter] in their WHERE clause
    and [Grafana_interval] in a GROUP BY time clause to reduce the size of the query.
    The GROUP BY time clause should usually also contain a FILL clause to make
    continuous graphs instead of bunches of dots.

    Example query:
    [
      InfluxDB.select
        [Function (MEAN, Field "duration")]
        ~from:(Measurement "rpc")
        ~where:Grafana_time_filter
        ~group_by:(Time {interval = Grafana_interval; tag = None; fill = Some Previous})
    ] *)

  title : string;
  description : string;
  queries : InfluxDB.select list;
  yaxis_1 : yaxis option;
  yaxis_2 : yaxis option;
}

(** Grafana panels.

    Rows are horizontal separators between graphs, with a title. *)
type panel = Row of string | Graph of graph

(** Grafana dashboards.

    [uid] is a unique identifier of your choosing.
    It will be used in the URL of the dashboard.
    It must be composed of between 1 and 128 alphanumeric characters, dashes, periods
    or underscores. *)
type dashboard = {
  uid : string;
  title : string;
  description : string;
  panels : panel list;
}

(** Create or update a dashboard.

    If the dashboard already exists, it is deleted first.
    All version history is lost.

    @raise Invalid_arg if the dashboard UID is invalid. *)
val update_dashboard : config -> dashboard -> unit Lwt.t

(** Make a simple SELECT query for a graph panel.

    Usage: [simple_query measurement field]

    This returns the following query:
    [
      SELECT MEAN(field)
      FROM measurement
      WHERE $timeFilter
      GROUP BY time($__interval) fill(previous)
    ] *)
val simple_query : InfluxDB.measurement -> InfluxDB.field -> InfluxDB.select

(** Make a graph panel from a simple query.

    The query is built using {!simple_query}.

    Default [title] is the measurement name.
    Default [description] is [""].
    Default [yaxis_format] is [s] (seconds). *)

  ?title:string ->
  ?description:string ->
