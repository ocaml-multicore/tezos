The consensus algorithm
=======================

This document provides a high-level description of Tenderbake, the Tezos
:doc:`proof-of-stake<proof_of_stake>` consensus algorithm, as implemented in the
I protocol.

History
-------

Before Tenderbake, there was
`Emmy* <https://gitlab.com/tzip/tzip/-/blob/master/drafts/current/draft_emmy-star.md>`_,
a Nakamoto-style consensus consisting of a series of improvements of the one in
the `Tezos whitepaper <https://whitepaper.io/document/376/tezos-whitepaper>`_.

Emmy*, like any Nakamoto-style consensus algorithm (such as `Bitcoin
<https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf>`_ or `Ouroboros
<https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/889>`_), offers *probabilistic*
finality: forks of arbitrary length are possible but they collapse
with a probability that increases rapidly with fork length.

`Tenderbake <https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.11965>`_ instead, like any classic
BFT-style consensus algorithm (such as
`PBFT <http://pmg.csail.mit.edu/papers/osdi99.pdf>`_ or
`Tendermint <https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.04938>`_), offers *deterministic*
finality: a block that has just been appended to the chain of some node is known
to be final once it has two additional blocks on top of it, regardless of
network latency.


Overview
--------

The starting point for Tenderbake is
`Tendermint <https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.04938>`_, the first classic-style algorithm
for blockchains.

Tenderbake adapts Tendermint to the Tezos blockchain, but the adjustments
required are
`substantive <https://blog.nomadic-labs.com/a-look-ahead-to-tenderbake.html#the-tezos-architecture>`_:

* Tenderbake is tailored to match the Tezos architecture by using only
  communication primitives and network assumptions which Tezos supports.
* Tenderbake makes weaker network assumptions than Tendermint, at the price of
  adding the extra assumption that participants have loosely synchronized clocks
  â€” which is fine, because Tezos already uses them.

The design of Tenderbake and its rationale are described at
length in the `technical report <https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.11965>`_ and in a
`Nomadic Labs's blog
post <https://blog.nomadic-labs.com/a-look-ahead-to-tenderbake.html>`_. Here we
only provide a user/developer perspective.
Tenderbake is executed for each new block level by a "committee" whose members
are called *validators*, which are delegates selected at random based on their
stake, in the same way as endorsers are selected in Emmy*. We let
``CONSENSUS_COMMITTEE_SIZE`` be the number of validator slots per level. This
constant has the role of ``ENDORSERS_PER_BLOCK`` in Emmy*.
Furthermore, we use ``CONSENSUS_THRESHOLD`` to denote two thirds of ``CONSENSUS_COMMITTEE_SIZE``.

For each level, Tenderbake proceeds in rounds. Each *round* represents an
attempt by the validators to agree on the content of the block for the current
level, that is, on the sequence of non-consensus operations the block contains.
We call this sequence the block's *payload*.

Each round has an associated duration. Round durations are set to increase so
that for any possible message delay, there is a round that is sufficiently long
for all required messages to be exchanged.
Round durations depend on protocol parameters ``MINIMAL_BLOCK_DELAY`` and ``DELAY_INCREMENT_PER_ROUND``.
These parameters specify round durations as follows:

.. math::

     round\_duration(0) &= minimal\_block\_delay \\
     round\_duration(r+1) &= round\_duration(r) + delay\_increment\_per\_round \\
     & = minimal\_block\_delay + (r + 1) * delay\_increment\_per\_round

Round durations thus increase linearly with ``DELAY_INCREMENT_PER_ROUND``.

Schematically, a round consists in the following steps:

* a validator designated for that round injects a *candidate block* (representing a proposal) and consensus operations (representing votes) into the node to which it is attached, which then
* diffuses those blocks and consensus operations to other nodes of the network, and thus
* communicates them to the validators attached to those nodes, to carry out voting on which block to accept.

Unlike Emmy*, Tenderbake has `two types of
votes <https://blog.nomadic-labs.com/a-look-ahead-to-tenderbake.html#why-do-we-need-preendorsements>`_:
before endorsing a block ``b``, a validator preendorses ``b``. Furthermore,
to be able to endorse, a validator must have observed a preendorsement *quorum*, that is a
set of preendorsements from validators having at least ``CONSENSUS_THRESHOLD`` validator slots. Similarly, to be able to decide, a validator must have observed an endorsement quorum, that is, a set of endorsements from validators having at least ``CONSENSUS_THRESHOLD`` validator slots. The
endorsement quorum for a block ``b`` is included in a block ``b'`` on top of ``b``,
serving as a certification that ``b`` has been agreed upon.
We also say that block ``b'`` confirms block ``b``.

The validator's whose turn is to inject a candidate block at a given round is
called the *proposer* at that round. Proposers in Tenderbake are selected
similarly to bakers in Emmy*: the proposer at round ``r`` is the
validator who has the validator slot ``r``. A proposer who has observed a
preendorsement quorum for a candidate block in a previous round, is required to propose a block with
the same *payload* as
the initial block. We talk about a *re-proposal* in this case.


.. _finality_alpha:

Transaction and block finality
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A transaction is final as soon as the block including it has a confirmation (that is, a block on top of it).
Indeed, as hinted above, a block contains the certification (that is, the endorsement quorum) for the previous
payload. Thanks to the endorsement quorum, Tenderbake guarantees **transaction finality
after 1 confirmation**.

It may be possible that different validators decide at different rounds, though on the same payload. The blocks at these different rounds differ precisely because they contain, in the header, as part of the block fitness,
the round at which they were proposed.
Among these "candidate" blocks, the block with the smallest round has the highest fitness and so it will be the one decided.
Consequently, to agree on a block, that is, on both the payload and the header, Tenderbake needs one more
confirmation, and thus guarantees
**block finality after 2 confirmations**.

Time between blocks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The time between blocks represents the difference between the timestamps of the blocks. The timestamp of a block is given by the beginning of the round at which the block has been agreed upon. Thus, the time between blocks depends on the round at which decisions are taken. For
example, if the decision at the previous level was taken at round 4 and at the current level at round 2, then the current block's delay relative to
its predecessor, is :math:`round\_duration(4) + round\_duration(0) + round\_duration(1)`.
The general case is as follows, say that the decision at the previous
level is taken at round ``m`` and the decision at the current level is
taken at round ``n``, then the current block's delay relative to its
predecessor is :math:`round\_duration(m) + \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} round\_duration(i)`.
We note that, under
normal network conditions, and with active and compliant validators, decisions
should be taken at round 0, meaning that the time between blocks would be
:math:`round\_duration(0)` seconds i.e., parameter ``MINIMAL_BLOCK_DELAY``.


Validator selection: staking balance, active stake, and frozen deposits
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Validator selection is based on the stake, as in Emmy*, with the exception that
it is based on the delegate's *active stake* instead of its *staking
balance* (or rather the corresponding rolls.
**NB**: rolls do not play a
role anymore, except for establishing a minimum required staking
balance). Let us first (re)define these and related concepts.

- The *(maximal) staking balance* of a delegate is its full balance (i.e. all the tokens owned by the delegate) plus the
  balances of all accounts that have delegated to it.
- The *active stake* of a delegate is the amount of tez with which
  it participates in consensus. It is at most its
  staking balance. It must be at least ``TOKEN_PER_ROLL`` tez. We explain below how it is computed.
- The *frozen deposit* represents a percentage ``FROZEN_DEPOSIT_PERCENTAGE``
  of the maximum active stake during the last ``PRESERVED_CYCLES + MAX_SLASHING_PERIOD``. This amount
  represents the delegate's skin in the game: in the case that the
  delegate behaves badly, its frozen deposit is partly slashed (see
  :ref:`slashing_alpha`).  Taking the maximum over an
  interval of cycles (instead of just considering the active stake at
  the cycle where the bad action can occur) allows to avoid situations
  where a malicious delegate empties its accounts between the time when
  rights are attributed and the time when the deposit is frozen. The frozen deposits are updated at the end of each cycle.
- The *spendable balance* of a delegate is its full balance
  minus the frozen deposits.

We state next the RPCs which allow to retrieve these types of balances, and also some invariants about them
(Note that these are just invariants, not definitions; for
instance, the frozen deposits are computed in terms of the full balance,
not the other way around.):

- ``delegated balance`` represents the total amount of tokens delegated by others to a
  given delegate; it excludes the delegate's full balance; it is obtained
  with ``../context/delegates/<pkh>/delegated_balance``
- ``staking balance = full balance + delegated balance``; it is obtained with
  ``../context/delegates/<pkh>/staking_balance``
- ``full balance = spendable balance + frozen deposit``; it is obtained with
  ``../context/delegates/<pkh>/full_balance``
- ``frozen deposit`` is obtained with ``../context/delegates/<pkh>/frozen_deposits``
- ``spendable balance`` is obtained with ``../context/contracts/<pkh>/balance``

Delegates can set an upper limit to their frozen deposits with the
commands ``tezos-client set deposit limit for <delegate> to
<deposit_limit>``, and unset this limit with the command ``tezos-client
unset deposit limit for <delegate>``. These commands are implemented by
using a new manager operation ``Set_deposits_limit``. When emitting such a
command in cycle ``c``, it affects the active stake for cycles starting
with ``c + PRESERVED_CYCLES + 1``; the new active stake is
taken into account when computing the frozen deposit for cycle ``c+1``
already, however the user may see an update to its frozen deposit at
cycle ``c + PRESERVED_CYCLES + MAX_SLASHING_PERIOD`` at the
latest (because up to that cycle the frozen deposit also depends on the
active stake at cycles before cycle ``c+1``).

The active stake is computed ``PRESERVED_CYCLES`` in advance: at
the end of cycle ``c`` for cycle ``c + PRESERVED_CYCLES`` (as in Emmy*). Intuitively,
the active stake is set to 10 times the delegate's chosen frozen
deposit limit, without going beyond its available staking balance,
nor its maximum staking capacity (determined by its full balance).
More precisely, the active stake is the minimum between:

- the delegate's staking balance, and
- 10 times the delegate's *deposit cap*, i.e. ``deposit_cap * 100 / deposit_percentage``. If the delegate has not set a frozen deposit limit, ``deposit_cap`` is its full balance. Otherwise ``deposit_cap`` is the minimum between its full balance and the frozen deposit limit set by the delegate.

Let's take some examples. Say that the full balance of a delegate is ``1000`` tez.
Then its theoretical maximum staking balance is
``10000`` tez. The following table lists some scenarios (assuming for
simplicity no changes in the delegate's full and staking balances
during the last 8 cycles).

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 20 20 20 20
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Staking balance
     - Frozen deposit limit
     - Active stake
     - Frozen deposit
     - Spendable balance

   * - 12000
     - 400
     - 4000
     - 400
     - 600

We note in passing that this new schema basically solves the main
problem of over-delegation: a delegate will not fail anymore to bake
and endorse because of an insufficient balance to pay the
deposit. However, a delegate can still be over-delegated, and it will be
rewarded based on its active stake, not on its staking balance.

Economic Incentives
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As Emmy*, Tenderbake rewards participation in consensus and punishes bad
behavior. Notable changes however are as follows:

* Fees and baking rewards go to the payload producer, the one who selected the
  transactions to be included in the block (and was the first to propose a
  block with that payload). In case of re-proposal, the payload producer might
  be different from the block proposer, the baker who injects the block.
* Including extra endorsements, that is, more than the minimal required to
  obtain a quorum, is rewarded with a bonus.
* Endorsing rewards are shared equally among all validators. Participation above
  a minimal threshold per cycle is however required.
* Deposits are no longer frozen and unfrozen, instead a percentage of the active stake is always locked.
* Validators are rewarded instantaneously for baking blocks and including extra endorsements, and not at the end of the cycle like in Emmy*.
* At the end of a cycle ``c``, the following actions happen:

  - the selection of the consensus committee cycle ``c + PRESERVED_CYCLES``, based on the current active stake distribution,
  - the distribution of endorsing rewards,
  - the adjustment of frozen deposits.


Fees
^^^^

The fees associated to the transactions included in a block go to the payload
producer. This is only natural given that this is the validator that selects the
transactions to be included; see `an in-depth blog
post <https://ex.rs/protocol-level-fees/>`_ for further motivation.

The payload producer is usually the same delegate as the block
proposer (that is, the one that signs and injects the block): that's
always true for blocks at round 0; however, in case of re-proposals
this is not necessarily the case (see the algorithm description above).

Fees are given to the payload producer immediately, that is, they are
already reflected in the blockchain state obtained after applying the injected
block.

Rewards
^^^^^^^

There are three kinds of rewards: baking rewards, endorsing rewards, and a bonus for including extra endorsements.

The baking rewards are treated in the same way as fees: they go to the *payload*
producer and are distributed immediately.

To encourage fairness and participation, the *block* proposer receives
a bonus for the extra endorsements it includes in the block.
The bonus is proportional to the number of
validator slots above the threshold of :math:`\lceil CONSENSUS\_COMMITTEE\_SIZE \times \frac{2}{3} \rceil` that
the included endorsements represent. The bonus is also distributed
immediately.

The endorsing rewards are distributed at the end of the cycle.
The endorsing reward may be received even if not all of the validator's endorsements are included in a block and is proportional to the validator's active stake (in other words, to its *expected* number of validator slots, and not its actual number of slots).
However, two conditions must be met:

 - the validator has revealed its nonce, and
 - the validator has been present during the cycle.

Not giving rewards in case of missing revelations is not new as it is :ref:`adapted<random_seed_alpha>`
from Emmy*.
The second condition is new. We say that a delegate is *present* during a cycle
if the endorsing power (that is, the number of validator slots at the
corresponding level) of all the endorsements included by the delegate during the
cycle represents at least ``MINIMAL_PARTICIPATION_RATIO`` of the delegate's expected number of
validator slots for the current cycle (which is ``BLOCKS_PER_CYCLE *
CONSENSUS_COMMITTEE_SIZE * active_stake / total_active_stake``).

Regarding the concrete values for rewards, we first fix the total reward per
level, call it ``total_rewards``, to ``80 / blocks_per_minute`` tez.
Assuming ``blocks_per_minute = 2``, ``total_rewards`` is 40 tez.
We define:

- ``BAKING_REWARD_FIXED_PORTION := baking_reward_ratio * total_rewards``
- ``bonus := (1 - baking_reward_ratio) * bonus_ratio * total_rewards`` is the max bonus
- ``endorsing_reward := (1 - baking_reward_ratio) * (1 - bonus_ratio) * total_rewards``

where:

- ``baking_reward_ratio`` to ``1 / 4``,
- ``bonus_ratio`` to ``1 / 3``.

Thus, we obtain ``BAKING_REWARD_FIXED_PORTION = 10`` tez,
(maximum) ``bonus = 10`` tez, and ``endorsing_rewards = 20`` tez.
The bonus per additional endorsement slot is in turn ``bonus /
(CONSENSUS_COMMITTEE_SIZE / 3)`` (because there are at most
``CONSENSUS_COMMITTEE_SIZE / 3`` validator slots corresponding to the
additional endorsements included in a block). The rewards per
endorsement slot are ``endorsing_rewards / CONSENSUS_COMMITTEE_SIZE``.
Assuming ``CONSENSUS_COMMITTEE_SIZE = 8000``, we obtain a bonus per slot of
``10 / (8000 / 3) = 0.00375`` tez and an endorsing
rewards per slot of ``20 / 8000 = 0.0025`` tez.

Let's take an example. Say a block has round 1, is proposed by
delegate B, and contains the payload from round 0 produced by delegate
A. Also, B includes endorsements with endorsing power ``6000``. Then A receives
the fees and 10 tez (the ``BAKING_REWARD_FIXED_PORTION``) as a reward for
producing the block's payload. For simpler calculations, let's assume
``CONSENSUS_COMMITTEE_SIZE = 8000``. Concerning the bonus, the minimum required validator slots is ``5334``, and there are ``2666 = 8000 - 5334`` additional validator slots.
Therefore B receives the bonus ``(6000 - 5334) * 0.00375 = 2.4975`` tez. (Note
that B only included endorsements corresponding to 666 additional validator slots, about a quarter of the
maximum 2666 extra endorsements it could have theoretically included.) Finally, consider some
delegate C, whose active stake at some cycle is 5% of the total stake. Note that
his expected number of validator slots for that cycle is ``5/100 * 8192 * 8000 =
3,276,800`` slots. Assume also that the endorsing power of C's endorsements
included during that cycle has been ``3,123,456`` slots. Given that this number is
bigger than the minimum required (``3,276,800 * 2 / 3``), it receives an endorsing
reward of ``3,276,800 * 0.0025 = 8192`` tez for that cycle.

.. _slashing_alpha:

Slashing
^^^^^^^^

Like in Emmy*, not revealing nonces and double signing are punishable. If a
validator does not reveal its nonce by the end of the cycle, it does not receive
its endorsing rewards. If a validator double signs, that is, it double bakes or
it double (pre)endorses (which means voting on two different proposals at the
same round), the frozen deposit is slashed. The slashed amount for double baking
is ``DOUBLE_BAKING_PUNISHMENT``. The slashed amount for double (pre)endorsing is
a fixed percentage ``RATIO_OF_FROZEN_DEPOSITS_SLASHED_PER_DOUBLE_ENDORSEMENT``
of the frozen deposit. The payload producer that includes the misbehavior
evidence is rewarded half of the slashed amount.

The evidence for double signing at a given level can be collected by any
:ref:`accuser<Accuser>` and included as an *accusation* operation in a block
for a period of ``MAX_SLASHING_PERIOD``.

We note that selfish baking is not an issue in Tenderbake: say we are at round
``r`` and the validator which is proposer at round ``r+1`` does not (pre)endorse
at round ``r`` in the hope that the block at round ``r`` is not agreed upon and
its turn comes to propose at round ``r+1``. Under the assumption that the
correct validators have more than two thirds of the total stake, these correct
validators have sufficient power for agreement to be reached, thus the lack of
participation of a selfish baker does not have an impact.

.. _shell_proto_revisit_alpha:

Shell-protocol interaction revisited
------------------------------------

:ref:`Recall<shell_proto_interact_alpha>` that, for the shell to interact with the economic protocol, two notions are defined abstractly at the level of the shell and made concrete at the level of the consensus protocol.
Namely, these two notions are the protocol-specific header and the fitness.
As in Emmy*, the protocol-specific header contains the fields:

- ``signature``: a digital signature of the shell and protocol headers (excluding the signature itself)
- ``seed_nonce_hash``: a commitment to :ref:`a random number<random_seed_alpha>`, used to generate entropy on the chain
- ``proof_of_work_nonce``: a nonce used to pass a low-difficulty proof-of-work for the block, as a spam prevention measure
- ``liquidity_baking_escape_vote``: :ref:`a flag<esc_hatch_alpha>` that requests ending the subsidy.

There are two additional fields: ``payload_hash`` and ``payload_round`` which are needed for establishing if a block is :ref:`final<finality_alpha>`.

.. _fitness_alpha:

The fitness is given by the tuple ``(level, locked_round, predecessor_round, round)``.
The fitness encapsulates more information than in Emmy* because Tenderbake is more complex: recall that blocks at the last level only represent :ref:`candidate blocks<finality_alpha>`.
In Emmy*, only the level mattered.
But in Tenderbake, we need to, for instance, allow for new blocks at the same level to be accepted by nodes.
Therefore the fitness also includes the block's round.
Furthermore, we also allow to change the predecessor block when it has a :ref:`smaller round<finality_alpha>`.
Therefore the fitness also includes the predecessor block's round.
