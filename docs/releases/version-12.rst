Version 12.0~rc1
================

Version 12.0 contains a new version (V4) of the protocol environment,
which is the set of functions that protocols can call. This new
version is used by protocol Ithaca, which is a proposal for the
successor of Hangzhou. This release candidate also contains Ithaca
itself as well as its daemons (baker and accuser â€” there is no
endorser for Ithaca) and the ``ithacanet`` built-in network alias
for the Ithacanet test network.
