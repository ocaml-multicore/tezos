# coq-of-ocaml

In this folder we put the files relevant to the compilation of the protocol to
Coq using [coq-of-ocaml](https://clarus.github.io/coq-of-ocaml/). The code of
the protocol is annotated with `[@coq_...]` OCaml attributes. These attributes
are here to help the compilation to Coq. We document them on:
https://clarus.github.io/coq-of-ocaml/docs/attributes

* `config.json` This file describes the configuration parameters for
  coq-of-ocaml in the CI. For more information, see the
  [documentation](https://clarus.github.io/coq-of-ocaml/docs/configuration).
