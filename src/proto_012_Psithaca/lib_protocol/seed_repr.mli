(** Tezos Protocol Implementation - Random number generation

    This is not expected to be a good cryptographic random number
    generator. In particular this is supposed to be used in situations
    where the seed is a globally known information.

    The only expected property is: It should be difficult to find a
    seed such that the generated sequence is a given one. *)
