(** This module provides a set of abstractions to reason about the
    so-called “liquidity baking” feature[1].

    [1]: https://gitlab.com/tezos/tzip/-/blob/master/drafts/current/draft-liquidity_baking.md

    We remind that this feature is built upon three smart contracts:
    (1) a CPMM contract initially based on Dexter 2, and (2) two
    tokens contracts.

    Our purpose for Liquidity Baking is to easily express and test
    invariants regarding the execution of these contracts.  To that
    end, we have introduced a set of dedicated types to describe
    arbitrary contexts in terms of account balances (see
    [Liquidity_baking_machine.specs]), along with [build] functions
    that turn a description of a context into concrete states.

    In this module, we provide QCheck generators which allow to
    construct arbitrary specifications for states, and so-called
    scenarios ({i i.e.}, sequences of entrypoint calls). *)

open Liquidity_baking_machine

(** [arb_specs max_tzbtc max_liquidity] constructs arbitrary Liquidity
    Baking [specs] for an initial state, where at most [max_tzbtc] and
    [max_liquidity] are shared among an arbitrary number of implicit
    accounts. *)
val arb_specs : tzbtc -> liquidity -> specs QCheck.arbitrary

(** [arb_scenario max_tzbtc max_liquidity size] constructs arbitrary
    Liquidity Baking [specs] with a semantics similar to [arb_specs], along with sequences of {b valid}
    scenarios ({i i.e.}, sequences of entrypoint calls) of length
    [size]. By valid, we mean that running the scenario using a
    Liquidity baking machine initialized with the [specs] should
    succeed. *)
val arb_scenario :
  tzbtc -> liquidity -> int -> (specs * contract_id step list) QCheck.arbitrary

(** [arb_adversary_scenario max_tzbtc max_liquidity size] constructs
    arbitrary scenarios that can be used to challenge the “no global
    gain” property of Liquidity Baking.

    The key idea of this property is the following: a given contract
    cannot profit from Liquidity Baking if they are the only one to
    interact with the CPMM (in the absence of subsidies). The scenario
    generated by [arb_adversary_scenario] only consists in [step]
    performed by one contract. This contract is identified by the
    [contract_id] returned by this function. *)
