  The shell uses the convention that a context at level n is the resulting
  context of the application of block n.
  Therefore when using an RPC on the last level of a voting period, the context
  that is inspected is the resulting one.

  However [Amendment.may_start_new_voting_period] is run at the end of voting
  period and it has to prepare the context for validating operations of the next
  period. This causes the counter-intuitive result that the info returned by RPCs
  at last level of a voting period mention data of the next voting period.

  For example, when validating the last block of a proposal period at level n
  we have:
  - Input context:

       voting_period = { kind = Proposal;
                         index = i;
                         start_position = n - blocks_per_voting_period}

       - position  = n - start_position = blocks_per_voting_period
       - remaining = blocks_per_voting_period - (position + 1) = 0

  - Output context:

       voting_period = { kind = Exploration;
                         index = i + 1;
                         start_position = n + 1}

      Now if we calculate position and remaining in the voting period we get
      strange results:
       - position  = n - (n + 1) = -1
       - remaining = blocks_per_voting_period

  To work around this issue, two RPCs were added
  `Voting_period_storage.get_rpc_current_info`, which returns the correct
  info also for the last context of a period, and
  `Voting_period_storage.get_rpc_succ_info`, which can be used at the last
  context of a period to craft operations that will be valid for the first
  block of the new period.

  This odd behaviour could be fixed if [Amendment.may_start_new_voting_period]
  was called when we start validating the first block of a voting period instead
  that at the end of the validation of the last block of a voting period.
  This should be carefully done because the voting period listing depends on
  the rolls and it might break some invariant.

  When this is implemented one should:
  - edit the function [reset_current] and [inc_current] to use the
    current level and not the next one.
  - remove the storage for pred_kind
  - make Voting_period_repr.t abstract

  You can also look at the MR description here:

(* Voting periods start at the first block of a cycle. More formally,
   the invariant of start_position with respect to cycle_position is:
     cycle_position mod blocks_per_cycle ==
     position_in_period mod blocks_per_cycle *)
