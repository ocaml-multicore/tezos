   the endorsements of at most 5 rounds and 1 level in the past, to be able to
   include as much endorsements as possible in the next block if this baker is
   the proposer. This allows to handle the following situations:

   - The baker observes an EQC for (L, R), but a proposal arrived for (L, R+1).
   After the flush, extra endorsements on top of (L, R) are 'Branch_refused',
   and are not re-sent by the node. If the baker proposes at (L+1, 1), he should
   be able to include these extra endorsements. Hence the cache for old rounds.

   - The baker receives a head at (L+1, 0) on top of (L, 0), but this head
   didn't reach consensus. If the baker who proposes at (L+1, 1) observed some
   extra endorsements for (L, 0) that are not included in (L+1, 0), he may want
   to add them. But these endorsements become 'Outdated' in the mempool once
   (L+1, 0) is received. Hence the cache for previous level.
