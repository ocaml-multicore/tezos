module Bounded : sig
  (** Data queues similar to the [Pipe] module in Jane Street's [Async]
    library. They are implemented with [Queue]s, limited in size, and
    use Lwt primitives for concurrent access. *)

  (** Type of queues holding values of type ['a]. *)
  type 'a t

  (** [create ~max_size ~compute_size ()] is an empty queue that can hold at
      most [max_size] "bytes" of data, using [compute_size] to compute the
      number of "bytes" in a datum.

      Note that you can use [max_size]/[compute_size] to actually limit the size
      in byte (i.e., the memory footprint of the structure (in this case,
      consider using {!push_overhead} to account for the boilerplate memory),
      but you can also use [max_size]/[compute_size] to limit the footprint of
      the structure for some other resource. E.g., you can spin up tasks in
      separate processes and limit the number of concurrently running processes.

      Also note that the size bound is not inclusive. So with [max_size] set to
      [2] and [compute_size] to [fun _ -> 1] you can add one (1) element and
      then the pipe is full. (It is full because adding any other element would
      take the total size to [2] which is not strictly smaller than the
      [max_size] bound.)

      Finally, note that when the pipe is empty, inserting an element will
      always succeed immediately, even if its size exceed the size bound. For
      the same reason, inserting an element bigger than the size bound will
      eventually succeeds, but only once the pipe has been emptied. Once such an
      element has been inserted, no other element can be pushed until the
      bigger-than-bound element is popped. This behaviour breaks the invariant
      guaranteed by the module, but is kept for backwards compatibility. It may
      be changed in the future, but only after a careful review of the potential
      impact. *)

  (** [push q v] is a promise that is pending until there is enough space in [q]
    to accommodate [v]. When this happens [v] is added to the end of [q] and the
    promise resolves.

    If there is enough space in [q] to accommodate [v] when the call is made,
    then the [v] is added immediately and an already resolved promise is
    returned.

    Note that if several writes are stuck because the pipe is full. These
    writes will succeed in an order that might be different from the order the
    write attempts were made. Specifically, when pushing elements of different
    computed sizes, smaller pushes may be resolved earlier if enough space is
    freed.
