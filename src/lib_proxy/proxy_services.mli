(** Whether using the light mode or the proxy mode (remember that
    the light mode is a different instance of the proxy mode
    (see srcs/lib_proxy/README_LIGHT.md for documentation)
    and whether [tezos-client] or [tezos-proxy-server] is running. *)
type mode =
  | Light_client of Light.sources  (** [tezos-client --mode light] is running *)
  | Proxy_client  (** [tezos-client --mode proxy] is running *)
  | Proxy_server of int option
      (** [tezos-proxy-server] is running and the [int option] value
          is the value of argument [--sym-block-caching-time] *)

(** [build_directory printer rpc_context env mode] returns the directory
    of RPCs that is served locally by the client's light and proxy modes and
    by the proxy server. Parameters are:

    - [printer] is used for logging.
    - [rpc_context] is used to perform RPCs to distant endpoints.
    - [mode] specifies whether [tezos-client] (light or proxy mode)
      or [tezos-proxy-server] is running.
    - [env] is a protocol-specific module used to create the context passed when executing a RPC. *)
