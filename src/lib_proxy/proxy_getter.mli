  (** The point of this data structure is as follows:

      Suppose [Make.cache] is like this, because key A has been
      requested already and the tree at A has two nodes B and C:

      A-B
       \
        C

      If proxy_getter receives a request for A-D, there's no point doing
      a request, even if it's not there; because as A has been requested
      already; if A-D was available, it would be there already.

      This is a crucial optimisation that reduces the number of .../raw/bytes
      RPC requests by 90% when executing baking_rights&?all=true locally,
      after the chain starts having more than a few cycles.
      More specifically, in baking_rights, the client keeps looking for
      (missing) keys of the form rolls;owner;snapshot;10;1;74;5;1354
      while the parent key rolls;owner;snapshot;10;1 has been obtained before.

      This structure has the invariant that all leaves are [All] nodes.
      If requests A;B and A;C have been done, the tree is as follows:

      A[Partial] -> B[All]
         \
          \-------> C[All]

      If then request A is done, the tree becomes:

      A[All]
