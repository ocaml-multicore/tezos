    - The field [in_mempool] is the set of all operation hashes
   present in fields: [refused; branch_refused; branch_delayed;
   prechecked; applied].

    - An operation cannot be at the same time in two of the following
   fields: [refused; branch_refused; branch_delayed; prechecked;
   applied].

    Note: unparsable operations are handled in a different way because
   they cannot be handled as a [Prevalidation.operation] since this
   datatype requires an operation to be parsable. Hence, unparsable
   operations are handled differently. In particular, unparsable
   operations are removed on flush.

    Note: We could always enforce these invariants by checking in
   {!add} whether the operation is already present. However, this
   would make the behavior of {!add} less predictable, so we do not
   think this to be an improvement from the point of view of the
   caller. *)

    fields of [classes]. If the [oph] was classified as [Applied], the
    function is in [O(n)] with [n] being the length of
    [classes.applied]. Otherwise, the function is [O(log n)] with [n]
    the number of operations in the corresponding class.

    If [oph] was found, its classification as well as the operation it
    was bound to are returned. If [oph] was not found, [None]
    is returned.

    {b Warning:} If an operation is removed from the [applied] field,
    this may invalidate the classification of all the other operations.

(** [add ~notify classification op classes] adds the operation [op]
    classified as [classification] to the classifier [classes]. The
   [classes.parameters.on_discarded_operation] callback is called for
   any operation discarded in this process. Currently, an operation is
   discarded in the following cases:

    - the corresponding error class field is full. In that case, the
   new operation is added to the class, and the removed one is
   discarded.

    - an operation is classified as [Refused].

    Note that a [Refused] operation may thus be passed twice to
   [on_discarded_operation]: as soon as it is added, and if it is
   removed because the [classes.refused] bounded map is full.

    As a summary:

    - [Applied] and [Prechecked] are never discarded

    - [Branch_refused] and [Branch_delayed] are discarded 0 or 1 time
   (if the corresponding bounded_map is full)

    - [Refused] is discarded 1 or 2 times (if the corresponding
   bounded_map is full) *)

    This function guarantees that the branch of all returned operations
    is in [live_blocks] ([live_blocks] acts as a filter).

    Operation which where included in [from_branch] and which are NOT in
    [to_branch] need to be parsed again using the [parse] argument. If the
    parsing fails those operations are just dropped. This may happen if those
    operations comes from another protocol.
