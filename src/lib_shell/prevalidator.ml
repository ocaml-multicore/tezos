(* General description of the prevalidator:

   The main role of the prevalidator is the propagation of valid
   operations through the gossip network of Tezos. The baker also uses
   the prevalidator via the [monitor_operations] RPC to filter
   operations that can be included in blocks.

   The prevalidator manages a validation state based upon the current
   head chosen by the validation sub-system. Each time the
   prevalidator receives an operation, it tries to classify it on top
   of the current validation state. If the application of the incoming
   operation succeeds, the validation state is then updated and, the
   operation can be propagated. Otherwise, the handling of the
   operation depends on the classification: [Applied],
   [Branch_delayed], [Branch_refused] or [Refused]. This
   classification is detailed below. Given an operation, its
   classification may change if the head changes. When the validation
   sub-system switches its head, it notifies the prevalidator with the
   new [live_blocks] and [live_operations], triggering also a [flush]
   of the mempool: every operation classified as [Applied] or
   [Branch_delayed] which is anchored (i.e, the [block hash] on which
   the operation is based on when it was created) on a [live block]
   and which is not in the [live operations] (operations which are
   included in [live_blocks]) is set [pending], meaning they are
   waiting to be classified again. Operations classified as
   [Branch_refused] are reclassified only if the old head is not the
   predecessor block of the new head. We use the
   [Chain_validator_worker_state.Event.update] for that purpose (see
   {on_flush}). [Refused] operations are never reclassified. We keep
   track on them to avoid to handle it if it is advertised again in a
   short period of time.

   Plugins may be used as an anti-spam protection mechanism, more
   restrictive than the economic protocol. They are not mandatory and
   come with the shell. By not mandatory, it means that without the
   plugin, the prevalidator still works. However, it may propagate
   outdated operations and the prevalidator can be slower. Indeed,
   plugins add more restrictions on the validation of operations. The
   plugin comes with three functions: [pre_filter], [precheck] and
   [post_filter]. With the exception of locally injected operations,
   pending operations are first pre-filtered.
   The [precheck] is applied before classifying an operation.
   The [post_filter] is applied every time an operation is classified
   as [Applied].

   Error classification:

   The [apply_operation] function from the economic protocol can
   classify an operation as [Refused], [Branch_refused],
   [Branch_delayed], [Outdated] or [Applied].

     - An operation is [Refused] if the protocol rejects this
   operation with an error classified as [Permanent].

     - An operation is [Outdated] if the operation is too old to be
   applied anymore or if the protocol rejects this operation with an
   error classified as [Outdated]

     - An operation is [Branch_refused] if the operation is anchored
   on a block that has not been validated by the node but could be in
   the future or if the protocol rejects this operation with an error
   classified as [Branch]. This semantics is likely to be weakened to
   also consider [Outdated] operations.

     - An operation is [Branch_delayed] if the initialization of the
   validation state failed (which presumably cannot happen currently)
   or if the protocol rejects this operation with an error classified
   as [Temporary].

     - An operation is [Applied] if it has been successfully
   prechecked, or if the economic protocol succeeded in applying the
   operation on the current validation state. The point of
   prechecking an operation is that it is faster than having the protocol apply
   the operation. Operations are stored in the reverse order of application
   so that adding a new [Applied] operation can be done at the head
   of the list.

   The [classification] data-structure (implemented in
   [Prevalidator_classification]) is used by the [prevalidator] to
   handle operations and their classification given either by the
   plugin or the economic protocol. One important property of this
   data-structure is to answer quickly if an operation is already
   classified or not.

   The interaction between the [Prevalidator_classification] module
   and the [Prevalidator] ensures an invariant that the different
   classifications are {e disjoint}: an operation cannot be in two (or
   more) of these subfields at the same time. The rationale to not
   make this invariant explicit is for performances reasons.

   Operation status:

     Operations are identified uniquely by their hash. Given an
   operation hash, the status can be either: [fetching], [pending],
   [classified], or [banned].

     - An operation is [fetching] if we only know its hash but we did
   not receive yet the corresponding operation.

     - An operation is [pending] if we know its hash and the
   corresponding operation but this operation is not classified on top
   of the current head yet.

     - An operation is [classified] if we know its hash, the
   corresponding operation and was classified according to the
   classification given above. Note that for [Branch_refused]
   operation, the classification may be prior to the last flush.

     - We may also ban an operation locally (through an RPC). A
   [banned] operation is removed from all other fields, and is ignored
   when it is received in any form (its hash, the corresponding
   operation, or a direct injection from the node).

     The prevalidator ensures that an operation cannot be at the same
   time in two of the following fields: [fetching], [pending],
   [in_mempool] (containing the [classified] operations), and
   [banned_operations].

   Propagation of operations:

     An operation is propagated through the [distributed database]
   component (aka [ddb]) which interacts directly with the [p2p]
   network. The prevalidator advertises its mempool (containing only
   operation hashes) through the [ddb]. If a remote peer requests an
   operation, such request will be handled directly by the [ddb]
   without going to the prevalidator. This is why every operation that
   is propagated by the prevalidator should also be in the [ddb]. But
   more important, an operation which we do not want to advertise
   should be removed explicitly from the [ddb] via the
   [Distributed_db.Operation.clear_or_cancel] function.

   It is important that every operation we do not want to propagate
   are cleaned up from the [Distributed_db] explicitely. Operations we
   do not want to propagate are operations classified as [Refused] or
   [Outdated], already included in block, or filtered out by the
   plugin.

   The [mempool] field contains only operations which are in the
   [in_mempool] field and that we accept to propagate. In particular,
   we do not propagate operations classified as [Refused] or
   [Outdated].

     There are two ways to propagate our mempool:

     - Either when we classify operations as applied

     - Or when a peer requests explicitly our mempool

     In the first case, only the newly classified operations are
   propagated. In the second case, current applied operations and
   pending operations are sent to the peer. Every time an operation is
   removed from the [in_mempool] field, this operation should be
   cleaned up in the [Distributed_db.Operation] requester.

   There is an [advertisement_delay] to postpone the next mempool
   advertisement if we advertised our mempool not long ago. Early
   consensus operations will be propagated once the block is
   validated. Every time an operation is [classified], it is recorded
   into the [operation_stream]. Such stream can be used by an external
   service to get the classification of an operation (via the
   [monitor_operations] RPC). This also means an operation can be
   notified several times if it is classified again after a
   [flush].

   Internally, the prevalidator implementation is split between
   the [Requests] module and the [Handlers] module.

   The [Requests] module contains the top-level functions called to implement
   the various requests defined in {!Prevalidator_worker_state}. These
   transitions form the meat of the prevalidator implementation: that is where
   the logic lies. This module is written in an imperative style: most
   functions return [unit] instead of returning an updated value.
   We aim to make this module functional in the near future.

   The [Handlers] module implement the functions needed by the
   {!Worker.T.HANDLERS} API. These functions concern the lifecycle
   of a [Worker], such as what happens when it starts and when it is shutdown.
   Except for initialization, the [Handlers] module is mostly boilerplate. *)

    The raison d'etre of these records of functions is to be able to use

    The purpose of the {!Tools.tools} record is to abstract away from {!Store.chain_store}.
    Under the hood [Store.chain_store] requires an Irmin store on disk,

    to create a temporary folder on disk which doesn't scale well.

    The purpose of the {!Tools.worker_tools} record is to abstract away
    from the {!Worker} implementation. This implementation is overkill
    for testing: we don't need asynchronicity and concurrency in our
    pretty basic existing tests. Having this abstraction allows to get
