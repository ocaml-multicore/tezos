        function hereby has a similar return type.

        Returns [`Passed_precheck `No_replace] if the operation was successfully

        plugin and returns [`Passed_prefilter priority] if no error occurs during
        checking of the [operation_data], where priority is the priority computed by
        the protocol filter plug-in. More tests are done using the
        [filter_state]. We classify an operation that passes the prefilter as
        [`Passed_prefilter] since we do not know yet if the operation is
        applicable or not. If an error occurs during the checks, this function
        returns an error corresponding to the kind of the error returned by the

        prevalidator, on operations that did not fail. It returns
        [`Passed_postfilter] if the operation passes the filter. It returns
        [`Refused] otherwise. This function both takes a [filter_state] as
