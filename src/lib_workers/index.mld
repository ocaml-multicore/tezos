{0 Workers: Local, Lwt-based event-loops}

The Workers library provides helpers for a component akin to agents or actors.
More concretely, you can use this library to instantiate a worker group, from
which you can spawn one or more workers, to which you can send tasks. Each
worker maintains a queue of tasks (called requests) and schedules them according
to its internal event-loop.
