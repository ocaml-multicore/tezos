(** {1 Lwt, result, and Lwt-result monad operators}

    This module provides the necessary functions and operators to use Lwt,
    Result and Lwt-Result as monads.

    {2 Basics}

    The three, tiered monads have each their own syntax module with
    {ul
      {li a [return] function,}
      {li preallocated [return_unit], [return_none], etc. values,}
      {li [let*] and [let+] bindind operators.}
    }
    In addition, the {!Lwt_syntax} module has [and*] and [and+] binding
    operators to allow concurrent evaluation of two or more promises, and the
    {!Result_syntax} and {!Lwt_result_syntax} have [fail] functions to
    error-out.

    {2 Joins}

    The {!Lwt_syntax.join} function takes a list of promises [ps] and returns a
    single promise [p] that resolves with [()] when all the promises of [ps]
    have resolved.

    The {!Lwt_syntax.all} function takes a list of promises [ps] and returns a
    single promise [p] that resolves when all the promises of [ps] have
    resolved. The value [p] resolves to is the list of values the promises of
    [ps] resolve to. The order is preserved.

    The {!Lwt_syntax.both} function takes two promises [p1] and [p2] and returns
    a single promise [p] that resolves when both promises [p1] and [p2] have
    resolved. The value [p] resolves to is the tuple of values the promises [p1]
    and [p2] resolve to.

    These Lwt-joining functions have a best-effort semantic: they only resolve
    once all the underlying promises have resolved.

    The {!Result_syntax} variants are equivalent for the result monad: the final
    result is [Ok] if all the underlying results are [Ok].

    The {!Lwt_result_syntax} variants are equivalent for the Lwt-result monad:
    the final promise resolves to [Ok] if all the underlying promise resolve to
    [Ok].

    {2 Lifting}

    Finally, the {!Lwt_result_syntax} module includes two facilities for lifting
    values from the more specilaised Lwt-only and Result-only monads.

    [let*!] binds a plain Lwt promise into an Lwt-Result promise.

{[
let open Lwt_result_syntax in
let*! x = f a b c in
…
]}

    [let*?] binds a plain result into an Lwt-Result promise.

{[
let open Lwt_result_syntax in
let*? y = f u v w in
…
]}

    In the cases where performance is not a grave concern, it is also possible to
    use [Lwt_result.ok] to lift Lwt-only expressions and [Lwt.return] to lift
    result-only expressions.
    More details on the matter within the documentation of
    {!Lwt_result_syntax.( let*! )} and {!Lwt_result_syntax.( let*? )}
    themselves. *)

        this function is for mixing results that carry different types of
        errors.

        E.g., considering [fetch : unit -> (string, unit) result Lwt.t] and
        [emit : string -> (unit, int) result Lwt.t], you can write

{[
let* data = lwt_map_error (fun () -> "fetching failed") @@ fetch () in
let* () =
  lwt_map_error (fun code -> Format.asprintf "emit failed (%d)")
  @@ emit data
in

        Result-only within the LwtResult monad. Note that there are fundamental
        differences between [result] and [Lwt.t]: the former can be simply
        matched on (i.e., it is possible to get out of the monad at any point)
        whereas the latter can only be bound on (i.e., it is not possible to get
        out of the monad). In addition, the former is for aborting computations
        on failures whereas the latter is for waiting before continuing.

        Still, from a syntax point-of-view, both are handled the same way: with
        a specialised binding operator. *)
