  (** [relative_position_within_block op1 op2] provides a partial and

     used as an argument to {!List.sort} (and other sorting/ordering
     functions) to arrange a set of operations into a sequence, the
     order of which is valid for the protocol.

     A negative (respectively, positive) results means that [op1]
     should appear before (and, respectively, after) [op2] in a
     block. This function does not provide a total ordering on the
     operations: a result of [0] entails that the protocol does not
     impose any preferences to the order in which [op1] and [op2]
     should be included in a block.

     {b Caveat Emptor!} [relative_position_within_block o1 o2 = 0]
     does NOT imply that [o1] is equal to [o2] in any way.
     Consequently, it {e MUST NOT} be used as a [compare] component of

     on a total comparison function. *)

     and it can also contain additional information that must be

     steps. *)

  (** [begin_partial_application cid ctxt] checks that a block is
     well-formed in a given context. This function should run quickly,
     as its main use is to reject bad blocks from the chain as early
     as possible. The input [ancestor_context] is expected to result
     from the application of an ancestor block of the current head
     with the same economic protocol. Said ancestor block is also
     required to be more recent (i.e., it has a greater level), than
     the current head's "last_allowed_fork_level".

      The resulting `validation_state` will be used for multi-pass
     validation. *)

     for validating a block, whose header is [bh]. *)

  (** [begin_construction] initializes a validation context for
     constructing a new block, as opposed to validating an existing
     block.

     This function can be used in two modes: with and without the
     optional [protocol_data] argument. With the latter, it is used by
     bakers to start the process for baking a new block. Without it,
     is used by the Shell's prevalidator to construct a virtual block,
     which carries the contents of the pre-applied operations of the
     mempool.

     When [protocol_data] is provided, it is not expected to be the
     final value of the field of the same name in the {!block_header}
     of the block eventually being baked. Instead, it is expected to
     construct a protocol-specific, good enough, "prototype" of its
     final value. For instance, if the economic protocol specifies
     that its block headers include a signature, [protocol_data] must
     include a (faked) signature.

     Moreover, these prototypes should not be distinguishable after
     the application of [begin_construction]: the function must
     produce the exact same context regardless of being passed a
     prototype, or an "equivalent-but-complete" header. *)

  (** [apply_operation vs op] applies the input operation [op] on top
     of the given {!validation_state} [vs]. It must be called after
     {!begin_application} or {!begin_construction}, and before
     {!finalize_block}, for each operation in a block. On a successful
     application, it returns a pair consisting of the resulting
     [validation_state], and the corresponding [operation_receipt]. *)
  val apply_operation :
    validation_state ->
    operation ->
    (validation_state * operation_receipt) tzresult Lwt.t

  (** [finalize_block vs] finalizes the context resulting from the
     application of the contents of the block being validated.

      If there is no protocol migration, i.e., if the block being
     applied is not the last block of the current economic protocol, the
     resulting context can be used in the future as input for the
     validation of its successor blocks. *)

  val rpc_services : rpc_context RPC_directory.t

  (** [init ctxt hd] initializes the context, or upgrades the context
     after a protocol amendment. This function receives as arguments
     the context [ctxt] resulting from the application of the block
     that triggered the amendment, as well as its header [hd]. This
     function should fail if the "protocol stitching", i.e., the
     transition from a valid previous protocol to the one being
     activated, has not been implemented. *)
  val init :
    Context.t -> Block_header.shell_header -> validation_result tzresult Lwt.t

  (** [value_of_key chain_id predecessor_context
     predecessor_timestamp predecessor_level predecessor_fitness
     predecessor timestamp] returns a function to build one value of
     the cache from its key.

     This function is used to restore all or part of the cache, for
     instance when booting a validator to preheat the cache, or when a
     reorganization happens. This function should never fail, returned
     errors are fatal.

     The generated function is passed to [Context.Cache.load_caches]
     which will use it either immediately a cache-loading time or
     on-demand, when a given cached value is accessed. *)
  val value_of_key :

end

(** [activate ctxt ph] activates an economic protocol (given by its
   hash [ph]) from the context [ctxt]. The resulting context is still
   a context for the current economic protocol, and the migration is
   not complete until [init] in invoked. *)
