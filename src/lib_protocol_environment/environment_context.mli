      The first mode is intended to be used after a rebooting of the
     node for example. The main benefit being that it does not impact
     the validation time of a block since the cache's values will be
     reconstructed beforehand. The second mode is intended to be used
     for RPCs where reactivity is important: we do not want to
     recompute the full cache to execute the RPC but only the values
     which are necessary. *)

          proportional to the number of entries in the cache, and depending on
          their nature. As a consequence, loading a cache from that
          source should be done when the system has no  strict constraint

          This strategy makes [load_cache] run a lot faster and the

          the number of entries *actually used* (and also depends on
          their nature).

          Notice that, contrary to the [`Load] source of cache, this
          loading mode may also introduce latencies when entries are
          actually used since they are reconstructed on-the-fly.

          RPCs are a typical place where this Lazy loading makes
          sense since the number of entries used is generally low,
          and the cache cannot be inherited (as in the next case).

          check some other block identified by a given [Context_hash.t],
          which typically comes after [block_cache.context_hash] in the
          chain.

          This source is usually the most efficient way to build a

          marginally from one block to one of its close descendants.

     uses the strategy described by [source], exploiting the [builder]
     to create cached values that are not already available in memory.

     The [builder] is assumed to never fail when evaluated on the keys
     of the cache domain. Indeed, if a key had an associated value in
     the cache at some point in the past, it should have been a valid
